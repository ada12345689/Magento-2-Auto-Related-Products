# Magento-2-Auto-Related-Products

The Magento 2 Auto-Related Product Extension recommends products similar to the customer's interest and recent order. These product recommendations are meant to encourage customers to make better purchases. After installing this module, a grid of recommended products is displayed on the webpage.

Whenever we go offline shopping and land at a brick-and-mortar store, the salesperson at the store asks what kind of products we are looking for, and once he understands our product description salesperson starts to show us some products. We go through all of them and select one or two of them, and once again, the salesperson shows us the products that are similar to our selected product. This method can be said to be the “offline Recommended-for-you” section. 

For decades this method has been very popular and profitable for businesses, and thousands of merchants have adopted this tactic.

Online stores do not have a living person as their salesperson on their website, so how do make the customers familiar with the products that are similar to their current search? The website displays similar products under the “recommended for you” section. MageComp’s extension is the only answer to this question.
